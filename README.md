If you want to use this programm, you will have to download first (also you can crate a python file with the format .py and just copy + paste it)
 -> After you downloaded it make sure you know where the file will be stored. For example you can save it to the desktop with the location C:\Users\<user>\Desktop (in the "<user>" you will have to write the name which is located in Users without the signs "<>") 
 -> After, you can simply double click the file (or also just run the program)

 -Alternative way:
 	-Run the windows powerShell as an administrator and navigate to the directory where your file is, and simply write uni and hit tab and enter
